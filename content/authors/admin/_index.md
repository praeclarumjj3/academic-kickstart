I am a CS sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I am a diligent Deep Learning enthusiast, diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, trying to find solutions to the unanswered problems in the field of AI to help humanity.

Currently, I am working as a **Visiting Student Researcher** at the [SHI Lab, University of Oregon](https://www.humphreyshi.com/people) under **Professor Humphrey Shi**.

At IIT Roorkee, I am a member of a Deep Learning-centric discussion group named the [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io). I am also a member of an Android Application Development group named the [Mobile Development Group](https://mdg.iitr.ac.in/).

To relax my mind amidst the madness that goes around the world, I listen to pop music and read books (mainly philosphical). I am one of those people who follows cricket as a religion. Do contact me if you want to discuss about pop-music, a little philosphy, cricket or just ping me, we will find a topic!
