I am a CS sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I am largely interested in Deep Learning, with applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

At IIT Roorkee, I am a member of a Deep Learning-centric discussion group named the [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io). I am also a member of an Android Application Development group named the [Mobile Development Group](https://mdg.iitr.ac.in/).
