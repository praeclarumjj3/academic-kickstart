I performed experiments on various backbone networks:

- ResNet-18/34/50/101

- MobileNetv2

- Xception Net

All the experiments were performed on a single **RTX 2080Ti GPU**, a single **TitanXP GPU** and a single **CPU** *indivdually*. For each model architecture, I collected the stats including:

- Execution Time

- Memory Used

- Number of Parameters
